An exercise in sorting through video game player data to determine the spending habits of various age and gender demographics.  At the end the data should show which groups spend the most, which game items attract the most buyers, and which game items provide the most value to the company.
The Heroes_tomknies file is the one with all of my work in it and the other is the original template with figures to double-check my work with.
